**Chronicle** is an Unreal Engine plugin for building narrative-driven games. It gives developers a visual way to create branching dialogues, hook up game logic through a rule system, manage characters, and cinematic timelines - all from within the editor.

## Modules

Chronicle is divided into separate modules for clarity and easier maintenance. Each module has its own detailed README in the `Docs/` folder.

### Dialogue System

## Roadmap (ish)

Planned features for Chronicle in no particular order:

- Nice looking UI for Rules and Characters setup
- Rules resolving runtime system
